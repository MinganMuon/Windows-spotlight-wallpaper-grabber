# Windows Spotlight Wallpaper Grabber

This script grabs the images that Windows uses as your lock screen, and copies them to a "Wallpapers" folder. To run, use `python .\run.py`. Intended for use as a scheduled task, running daily, and with your desktop configured to cycle through your "Wallpapers" folder.
